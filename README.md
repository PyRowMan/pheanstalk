Pyrowman/Pheanstalk
==========


Pheanstalk is a pure PHP 5.3+ client for the [evqueue workqueue][1].  It has
been actively developed, and used in production by many, since late 2008.

Pheanstalk 3.0 introduces PHP namespaces, PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards,
and PSR-4 autoloader standard.

This project is a fork from the [original Pheanstalk][3] wich is a client for the beanstalkd workqueue.  
Special thanks to [Paul Annesley][2]; the original creator of the library.

Installation with Composer
-------------

Install pheanstalk as a dependency with composer:

```bash
composer require pyrowman/pheanstalk
```


Usage Example
-------------

```php
<?php

// Hopefully you're using Composer autoloading.

use Pheanstalk\Pheanstalk;

$pheanstalk = new Pheanstalk('127.0.0.1');

// ----------------------------------------
// producer (queues jobs)

$pheanstalk
  ->useTube('testtube')
  ->put("job payload goes here\n");

// ----------------------------------------
// worker (performs jobs)

$job = $pheanstalk
  ->watch('testtube')
  ->ignore('default')
  ->reserve();

echo $job->getData();

$pheanstalk->delete($job);

// ----------------------------------------
// check server availability

$pheanstalk->getConnection()->isServiceListening(); // true or false

```


Running the tests
-----------------

There is a section of the test suite which depends on a running beanstalkd
at 127.0.0.1:5000, which was previously opt-in via `--with-server`.
Since porting to PHPUnit, all tests are run at once. Feel free to submit
a pull request to rectify this.

```
