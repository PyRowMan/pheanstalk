Pyrowman/Pheanstalk
==========


Pheanstalk is a pure PHP 7.1+ client for the [evqueue workqueue][1].

Pheanstalk 3.0 introduces PHP namespaces, PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards,
and PSR-4 autoloader standard.

This project is a fork from the [original Pheanstalk][3] wich is a client for the beanstalkd workqueue.  
Special thanks to [Paul Annesley][2]; the original creator of the library.

Installation with Composer
-------------

Install pheanstalk as a dependency with composer:

```bash
composer require pyrowman/pheanstalk
```


Usage Example
-------------

```php
<?php

// Hopefully you're using Composer autoloading.

use Pheanstalk\Pheanstalk;

$pheanstalk = new Pheanstalk('127.0.0.1');


// Create a simple Worflow with one job inside

$workflow = $pheanstalk->createTask('Sleep', 'Test', '/bin/sleep 80');

// Put the job into instance execution

$pheanstalk->put($workflow);

// ----------------------------------------
// check server availability

$pheanstalk->getConnection()->isServiceListening(); // true or false

//-----------------------------------------
// Add a scheduler for the job (by default in continous)

$workflowSchedule = $pheanstalk->createSchedule($workflow, new TimeSchedule());

//-----------------------------------------
// Getting infos on the execution of a workflow
$workflowInstancesExecuting = $pheanstalk->getWorkflowInstances($workflow, GetWorkflowInstancesCommand::FILTER_EXECUTING);
$workflowInstancesTerminated = $pheanstalk->getWorkflowInstances($workflow, GetWorkflowInstancesCommand::FILTER_TERMINATED);

//-----------------------------------------
// Delete a job 

if ($workflow = $pheanstalk->workflowExists('Sleep'))
    $pheanstalk->delete($workflow);

```


Running the tests
-----------------

There is a section of the test suite which depends on a running beanstalkd
at 127.0.0.1:5000, which was previously opt-in via `--with-server`.
Since porting to PHPUnit, all tests are run at once. Feel free to submit
a pull request to rectify this.
